# You'll Be Back

They say the price of **my war**'s not a price that they're willing to pay.\
And they cry in their tea which they hurl in the sea when they see me go by.\
_Why so sad_?\
Remember we made an arrangement when you went away\
Now you're making me mad.\
Remember despite our estrangement, I'm your man.\
\
You'll be back, soon you'll see.\
You'll remember you belong to me.\
You'll be back, time will tell.\
You'll remember that I served you well.
